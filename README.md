scoop-extras
============

The "extras" bucket for [Scoop](http://scoop.sh), for anything that doesn't fit in the [main bucket](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/tree/master/bucket).

To make it easy to install apps from this bucket, run
    scoop bucket add extras

## Why does this exist?

For an app to be acceptable for the main bucket, it should be:

* open source
* a command-line program
* the latest stable version of the program
* reasonably well-known and widely used

The "extras" bucket has more relaxed requirements, so it's a good place to put anything that doesn't quite fit in the main bucket.
