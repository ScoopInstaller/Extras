    "description": "Frog Pursuit is a custom Unreal Engine build that pans a test pattern of my variously colored dumpy tree frogs across the screen at a user-selectable framerate. Because Frog Pursuit is a fullscreen (either exclusive or borderless windowed) DX11 \"game,\" you can test your monitor for blur and overdrive artifacts across its full adaptive sync range. It's also useful for testing motion clarity during backlight strobing modes.",
